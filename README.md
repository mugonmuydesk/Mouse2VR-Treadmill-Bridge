2. Extract to any folder
3. Run `Mouse2VR_WebView.exe` for the GUI version
4. Or run `Mouse2VR.exe` for console/debugging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Security Notice
Windows Defender may flag the app as unrecognized. This is normal for unsigned software. Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway" to proceed. The app is [open source](https://github.com/mugonmuydesk/Mouse2VR-Treadmill-Bridge) and safe.

## üîß Physical Setup

### What You Need
- USB mouse (any DPI, optical recommended)
- Way to mount mouse to treadmill frame
- Mouse sensor positioned to read belt movement

### Setup Steps
1. **Mount the mouse** securely to your treadmill frame
2. **Position sensor** 1-5mm above the belt for optimal tracking
3. **Ensure good lighting** - sensor needs to see belt texture
4. **Connect to PC** via USB
5. **Configure your VR game** to accept Xbox controller input for movement

```

```

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Quick Start
1. Launch Mouse2VR_WebView.exe
2. Toggle "Enable Virtual Controller" ON (default)
3. Start walking on treadmill
4. See your speed in the app
5. Launch your VR game and configure it for gamepad locomotion

### Settings Explained

**Sensitivity (0.1 - 3.0)**  
Multiplies mouse input. Default 1.0 works for most setups.
- Lower = need more belt movement for same game speed
- Higher = less belt movement needed

**Target Update Rate**  
How often to process input (Hz). Higher = more responsive.
- 25 Hz - Low latency, minimal CPU usage
- 45 Hz - Balanced performance
- 60 Hz - Smoothest movement

**Axis Options**
- **Invert Y** - Reverses forward/backward if needed
- **Lock X** - Disables side-to-side (treadmill = forward/back only)
- **Adaptive Mode** - (Future) Dynamic sensitivity based on speed

## üìä Understanding Mouse Input

### How Mouse DPI Affects Speed

The app reads mouse movement in "counts" (also called mickeys). Your mouse DPI determines how many counts equal real-world distance:

- **800 DPI mouse** = 800 counts per inch = ~31,500 counts per meter
- **1600 DPI mouse** = 1600 counts per inch = ~63,000 counts per meter
- **400 DPI mouse** = 400 counts per inch = ~15,750 counts per meter

The app now includes DPI calibration settings. Select your mouse DPI from the settings panel (default: 1000 DPI) for accurate speed measurements in m/s. Use the 5-second test feature to verify your settings.

### Performance Metrics

**Target vs Actual Update Rate**  
With v2.8.3 performance optimizations:
- Target 25 Hz ‚Üí Actual 24-25 Hz
- Target 45 Hz ‚Üí Actual 44-45 Hz (stable)
- Target 60 Hz ‚Üí Actual 58-60 Hz

The app now uses high-resolution timers (1ms precision) and QueryPerformanceCounter for accurate timing. UI updates at 5 Hz to reduce overhead while maintaining responsiveness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Mouse Not Detected
- Run as Administrator
- Check mouse is plugged in before launching
- Try the console version to see debug output

### No Movement in Game
- Ensure ViGEmBus driver is installed
- Check game accepts Xbox controller input
- Verify "Enable Virtual Controller" is ON
- Look for green "Running" status

### Erratic Movement
- Clean mouse sensor lens
- Check belt has visible texture (not pure black)
- Adjust mounting distance (1-5mm from belt)
- Try different sensitivity settings

### Performance Issues
- Lower target update rate to 25 Hz
- Close other USB polling software
- Check CPU usage in Task Manager

- Curved speed-to-stick mapping
- SteamVR overlay integration

## üß™ Testing Status

### Automated Testing
A comprehensive automated test suite has been implemented to validate that all runtime settings affect behavior correctly:

- **DPI Settings Validation** - Tests 400, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 3200 DPI
- **Sensitivity Scaling** - Tests 0.5x, 1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x sensitivity  
- **Update Rate Tests** - Validates 25 Hz, 45 Hz, 60 Hz processing frequencies
- **Axis Options** - Tests Y-axis inversion and X-axis lock
- **Virtual Controller Toggle** - Tests enable/disable behavior
- **Runtime Setting Changes** - Validates settings can change during operation
- **WebView Rate Validation** - Ensures WebView polling matches target Hz
- **Cross-Setting Persistence** - Tests multiple settings don't revert to defaults

**Current Status**: Tests compile successfully but require ViGEm driver to run. CI environment lacks driver support, so tests must be run locally on development machines with ViGEm installed.

### Enhanced Logging (v2.8.5+)
Every log entry now includes complete settings snapshot:
```
[2025-09-04 10:45:23] [INFO] [Core] Message [DPI:1000|Sens:1.0|Hz:45|InvY:0|LockX:1|Run:1|ActHz:44|Spd:0.25|Stk:4.1%]
```

This provides moment-by-moment tracking of all settings changes, making it easy to verify settings propagation and debug issues.
